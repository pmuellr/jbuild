jbuild - a JavaScript-based build tool
================================================================================

Another flavor of make, using node.

Install globally via: (sudo not needed for windows)

    sudo npm -g install jbuild

This will install a global command `jbuild`.

`jbuild` expects you to have a `jbuild.js` or `jbuild.coffee` node module
in the current directory.  The module should export a property for every
task you want to define for your build.  The property should be an object
with two properties: `doc` which is a single line description of your task,
and `run` which is the function to run when the task is invoked.

You can also define tasks using the `defineTasks()` function described
below.

When you run `jbuild` with no arguments, it will do one of two things,
depending on how many tasks are defined (exported) from your module.

* When only one task is defined in a module, that task will be run.

* Otherwise, some help will be printed, as well
  as the tasks in your `jbuild` module, and the doc entries for those
  tasks.

To run a task in your `jbuild` module, invoke `jbuild` with that task as
the first argument.  You can pass further arguments on the command line, and
they will be passed to the task's function.

The shelljs package (<https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs>) is installed
"globally", so that all the functions are available in your module.  For
example, in the example below, the "echo" function is used, which is one of the
shelljs global functions.

A handful of additional "global" functions are provided by jbuild,
for your tasks, as described below.

In addition, jbuild will define "global" functions for all the scripts in
your `node_modules/.bin` directory.  The functions will be defined
exactly like [shelljs's `exec()` function][1]. Some example invocations
for a script `node_modules/.bin/foop`, from CoffeeScript:

    # run `foop` in with args "1 2 3", sync, output to stdout
    foop "1 2 3"

    # run `foop` in with args "4", async, capturing code and output when done
    foop "4", silent:true, (code,output) -> console.log output

Scripts with names which contain characters not legal in a JavaScript identifier
will be installed with names where those characters are replaced with the underscore
character.  Eg,
`cat-source-map` is available as the function `cat_source_map`.


example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

contents of a `jbuild.coffee` file

```coffee
exports.echo =
    doc: "echo's it's arguments to stdout"
    run: (args...) ->
        echo args.join " "
```

The JavaScript version, `jbuild.js`, would be this:

```js
exports.echo = {
    doc: "echo's it's arguments to stdout",
    run: function() {
        var args = [].slice.call(arguments)
        echo(args.join(" "));
    }
}
```

When you invoke:

    jbuild echo hello world

you will see the following output:

    hello world



additional global functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### `log(message)`

will write `message` to the console, prefixed by the program name
prefix.  If you pass an empty string, an blank line will be printed


### `logError([err,] message)`

will write `message` to the console, prefixed by the program name
prefix.  If `err` is non-null, it will print the error's stack trace.
The function will then exit the program by calling `process.exit(1)`.

The `err` parameter is optional.


### `watch(watchSpec)`

will watch the files specified in the `watchSpec` argument for
changes, and when a change occurs, run the command specified in
the `watchSpec` argument.  Once the command has completed, the
files will be watched again, and when a change occurrs, run
the command specified.  For ever.

`watchSpec` is an object with two properties: `files` which is a string or
array of strings which should be file specifications, and `run` which is
the function to run when one of those files changes.

For more information, see
the section on the `watch(watchSpec)` function.  You can run
the `watch()` function multiple times, to watch different files
and act upon them independently.


### `watchFiles(watchFilesSpec)`

will invoke the `watch()` function, but takes a slightly different object.

`watch()` expects an object with two properties: `files` and `run`, where
`files` is a string or array of strings, and `run` is a function.

`watchFiles()` expects an object where the keys are the files to watch
and the value associated with the key is the function to run.  The keys
are space-separated lists of the same file specifications that the
`watch()` function supports.

This code using `watchFiles()`:

    watchFiles
        "src/*.coffee src/*.js" :-> build()
        "out/*"                 :-> test()

is exactly the same as this code using `watch()`:

    watch
        files: ["src/*.coffee", "src/*.js"]
        run:   -> build()

    watch
        files: "out/*"
        run:   -> test()


### `server.start(pidFile, program, args[, options])`

will create a new process with `child_process.spawn(program, args, options)`
and capture the pid for that process in `pidFile`.  It will also invoke
`server.kill(pidFile)` before spawning the program.

To be specific,
`server.kill()` is invoked with a callback which actually spawns the
program, to give the event queue a chance to breathe between killing
and respawning a program.


### `server.kill(pidFile[, callback])`

will read the pid from `pidFile`, invoke `process.kill()` on it, and
then call the `callback` on `process.nextTick()`.


### `defineTasks(exports, tasksSpec)`

provides an alternative to defining your tasks as objects exported from
your module with `doc` and `run` properties.

The `exports` argument should be the object which exports properties from
your module.  Typically you'd just pass in the `exports` object provided
to your module, but if you're making use of `module.exports`, you may
need to pass that.

The `tasksSpec` argument should be an object where the keys are the name
of the tasks, and the values of those keys are what you would use in the
`doc` property when defining tasks.

The `defineTasks()` function will return an object which you should add
the `run` functions to, using the same key that you used in the `tasksSpec`
argument.

This code using `defineTasks()`

    tasks = defineTasks exports,
        build:  "build the code"
        test:   "test the code"

    tasks.build = -> build()
    tasks.test  = -> test()

is exactly the same as this code defining the tasks as exports

    exports.build =
        doc: "build the code"
        run: -> build()

    exports.test =
        doc: "test the code"
        run: -> test()

You can mix-and-match the two styles of defining tasks.  The `defineTasks()`
function just adds tasks specifications to the exports object passed in.


### `defineModuleFunctions(dir)`

This function will add global functions for all the scripts in the
directory `path.join(dir, "node_modules", ".bin")` in the same way as
as they are added for your current directory automatically.  


the `watch(watchSpec)` global function
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The global `watch()` function takes a single argument `watchSpec`.
`watchSpec` should be an object with two properties:

* `files` - a wild-card enabled file specification of files to watch
  for changes

* `run` - a function which will be invoked when a file changes

The `files` property must be a string or array of strings which
can contain [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)
wildcards, which will be compared to all the files in the
current directory.  The comparison is against the path relative
to the current directory, so the files arguments must not
contain path entries above the current directory.  For example,
you can't use `__filename` as an argument, as that variable
is a fully qualified filename.  Use `path.basename(__filename)`
instead.

The `run` property is the function to run when a file changes.
It will be passed the first file name that was noticed to
have changed.  Once one file has been noticed to change,
the file watching is stopped, the command is run, and then
file watching begins again.  Specifically, the `run` function
will not be called for every file that changes.
